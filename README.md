# Craft Academy Journey [WIP]

**Week 1**

When the magic of coding started! 

We were introduced to new concepts like Git/Github,  Ruby on Rails, and many talks by our coaches touching upon how important it's our mental health during the bootcamp.

Talks went through:
- Learning strategies.
- Pair programming.
- Communication Skills
- How to keep motivated.
- The right way to search the internet for information.
- Problem statement.

The main project this week was to simulate the behavior of a real ATM machine this includes:
- Withdraw money.
- Capable of deposit money on client's accounts/ Create an account.
- Capable of recognizing different sad paths like Card Expired, Wrong ping, Account check.

* [ATM](https://github.com/JaimeCrz/ATM_Challenge). 
Thanks Janko and Blake for this awesome first week.

* Weekend challenge:
During friday to monday we were introduced to a weekend challenge that covered up all what we learnt during the week plus:

- Practice TDD to drive your development process
- Adapt to a new domain
- Work with data stored in hashes and perform
- Learn about YAML
- Learn about storing information in a text file
- Practice writing documentation
- Learn to write user stories
- Practice Pair programming

- [Library Challenge](https://github.com/JaimeCrz/library-challenge)
Thanks Daniel for sharing with me this awesome weekend!

**Week 2**

We stepped up the complexity of the bootcamp by simulating a work environment to work on an application that is undocumented and not actively maintained.

We as a team had the task to test/ find bugs and broken functionality in the code base and deploy it to a staging server to get it to a state where adding new functionality is possible

Our learning objectives this week were focuse on: 

- Agile methods for software development. 

-  More Pair Programming <3.

- Collaboration using Git and GitHub.

- Test & Behavior Driven Development.

- Learn about the different parts of Ruby on Rails.

- Learn to read technical documentation.

- Introduction to Heroku.

* Weekend challenge:
During friday to monday we were introduced to a weekend challenge that covered up all what we learnt during the week plus:

- Authenticating the user.(Verify someone's identity with device token auth).
- User can create an Article only when he is logged in.

Thanks to Philip, Karro and Anish for the awesome experience!

**Week 3**

It's when CA gave us wings and allows us to create our own portfolio made with REACT.js, working individually to make a small step towards finding a job once the Bootcamp is done thanks to a wonderfull portafolio.

We were introduced to:
- Build from ground up a React app.(hello world full setup)
- Scaffolding an React app with npx.
- testing with Cypress.

* [live page](https://jcruz.netlify.app/)


**Week 4**

In this week we were challenged to build two applications with front-end made in React.js and back end in Ruby on rails.

First app:

This app theme is as a BMI calculator were we got introduced to Jest with Enzyme for components testing.

Second app:

The second app theme is as a cooper calculator that takes in consideration the meters that you were capable of running in 12 minutes as well as your age and makes the proper calculations showing you how good your performance is.

Thank you Anish for this week of headeaches! but we made it through!


**Week 5**

The fifth week we boarded a new week of big management projects with groups of 4 people, our learning objectives this week would be focused on:

* Use basic Agile practices
- self-organizing teams
- iterative and incremental design*
- the importance of planning your work

* Learn about Ruby on Rails as an API
- understand the concept of ORM's vs SQL (ActiveRecord)
- understand the MVC structure
- controllers
- routes
- models
- relation between models
- concept of params 

* Learn more about React
- understand how to consume an API
- understand the different requests (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE)
- how a react client fits into the MVC structure


* We made usage of a boilerplates and also got introduced to:
- Pivotal Tracker for project management.
- Extensive practices of Scrum.  

* Slowfood
[API](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slowfood_api_team_4)
[Front](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slowfood-client-team-4)


* Interview challenge where we needed to build an Rock paper scissors all by ourselves on our spare time, in order to simulate real life challenges that we might encounter with future interviews.

* [RPS Challenge](https://github.com/JaimeCrz/RPS_game)

**Week 6**
* Mid course project

**Week 7-9**
* News Room project

**Week 10**
* Tech week
- Git Internals
- Node.js


**Week 11-12**
* Final project week


**Interview Challenges**

*All interview contains the Think Aloud protocol.
-The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he or she are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an exercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his/her mind as she/he complete the task. This might include what he/she is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance.
