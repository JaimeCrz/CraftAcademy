# Craft Academy Journey [WIP]

**Week 1**

When the magic of coding started! 

We were introduced to new concepts like Git/Github,  Ruby on Rails, and many talks by our coaches touching upon how important it's our mental health during the bootcamp.

Talks went through:
- Learning strategies.
- Pair programming.
- Communication Skills
- How to keep motivated.
- The right way to search the internet for information.

The main project this week was to simulate the behavior of a real ATM machine this includes:

**Interview Challenges**

*All interview contains the Think Aloud protocol.
-The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he or she are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an exercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his/her mind as she/he complete the task. This might include what he/she is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance.
