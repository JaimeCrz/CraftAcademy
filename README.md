# Craft Academy Journey [WIP]

**Week 1**

When the magic of coding started! 

We were introduced to new concepts like Git/Github,  Ruby on Rails, and many talks by our coaches touching upon how important it's our mental health during the bootcamp.

Talks went through:
- Learning strategies.
- Pair programming.
- Communication Skills
- How to keep motivated.
- The right way to search the internet for information.
- Problem statement.

The main project this week was to simulate the behavior of a real ATM machine this includes:
- Withdraw money.
- Capable of deposit money on client's accounts/ Create an account.
- Capable of recognizing different sad paths like Card Expired, Wrong ping, Account check.

- Adapt to a new domain
- Work with data stored in hashes and perform
- Learn about YAML
- Learn about storing information in a text file
- Practice writing documentation
- Learn to write user stories

Thanks Daniel for sharing with me this awesome weekend!

**Week 2**

We stepped up the complexity of the bootcamp by simulating a work environment to work on an application that is undocumented and not actively maintained.

We as a team had the task to test/ find bugs and broken functionality in the code base and deploy it to a staging server to get it to a state where adding new functionality is possible

Our learning objectives this week were focuse on: 

- Agile methods for software development  

-  More Pair Programming <3   

- Collaboration using Git and GitHub  

- Test & Behavior Driven Development 

- Learn about the different parts of Ruby on Rails 

- Learn to read technical documentation

* [Legacy code Project.](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/legacy_team4_2020)

* Weekend challenge:
During friday to monday we were introduced to a weekend challenge that covered up all what we learnt during the week plus:

**Interview Challenges**

*All interview contains the Think Aloud protocol.
-The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he or she are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an exercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his/her mind as she/he complete the task. This might include what he/she is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance.
